     * @param  string  $queryId  The query identifier. This identifier is unique only in combination with a selling partner account ID.
     * @param  string  $query  The submitted query.
     * @param  \DateTimeInterface  $createdTime  The date and time when the query was created, in ISO 8601 date time format.
     * @param  string  $processingStatus  The processing status of the query.
     * @param  ?\DateTimeInterface  $processingStartTime  The date and time when the query processing started, in ISO 8601 date time format.
     * @param  ?\DateTimeInterface  $processingEndTime  The date and time when the query processing completed, in ISO 8601 date time format.
     * @param  ?string  $dataDocumentId  The data document identifier. This identifier is only present when there is data available as a result of the query. This identifier is unique only in combination with a selling partner account ID. Pass this identifier into the `getDocument` operation to get the information required to retrieve the data document's contents.
     * @param  ?string  $errorDocumentId  The error document identifier. This identifier is only present when an error occurs during query processing. This identifier is unique only in combination with a selling partner account ID. Pass this identifier into the `getDocument` operation to get the information required to retrieve the error document's contents.
     * @param  ?Pagination  $pagination  When a request has results that are not included in this response, pagination occurs. This means the results are divided into pages. To retrieve the next page, you must pass the `nextToken` as the `paginationToken` query parameter in the subsequent `getQueries` request. All other parameters must be provided with the same values that were provided with the request that generated this token, with the exception of `pageSize` which can be modified between calls to `getQueries`. When there are no more pages to fetch, the `nextToken` field will be absent.
